<h2>introduction to Programming languages</h2>
Programming is one of the most important elements of technological development; It is a technological process that specializes in the design, development and construction of a set of computer programs capable of performing certain mathematical operations
In addition, programming includes a set of tasks consisting in analyzing data, creating algorithms, and implementing them through different types of languages.
Since the source code of the program is written in one or more specific languages of the programmers clear language
Programming continued to evolve and diversify from its inception until it became one of the most important global technological developments with time progress.
And through its multiple tasks, which includes finding a series of instructions that work to perform the task and execute it on time.
Programming language, is an official technological language that includes a set of standard instructions that are specialized in producing a set of inputs and outputs and processing and implementing information Read
Programming languages are used in programming computer devices to implement algorithms, and computer programming languages consist of a variety of written instructions and codes which includes a set of instructions that can be executed directly by a computer

Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and with the advancement and technological development in the programming world, more of them are created each year, where many languages are written In the form of a series of operations and executable tasks.
The types of programming languages vary in terms of details, shapes, and functions, depending on the nature of the work of each language with its own details, where programming languages are among the basic components.
Programming languages are divided into three types namely High Level Language, Machine Language and Assembly Language

Programming languages are divided into three types namely High Level Language, Machine Language and Assembly Language.
Ranking And Types Of High-Level Programming Languages:
-Java: Java currently leads the pack in demand and popularity, largely due to its flexibility and portability. Java code is running on millions of devices worldwide, from mainframes to smartphones. This language runs legacy applications at Fortune 100 enterprises, and may even be found running on chips in “smart” appliances.
-C++: C++ is one of the most commonly used languages for such special purposes as 3D gaming, due to its efficient utilization of memory and consistent, smooth execution properties. Many developers of desktop applications utilize C++ for its ability to interact effectively with the operating system and hardware components.

<h2>-C:</h2>
 C was the foundation of C++ and is a high-performance language often used for operating systems and device drivers that must provide a quick response.

<h2>-Python:</h2>
 python has grown considerably in popularity in recent years, especially for creating websites and even mobile apps. 

<h2>-HTML/CSS:</h2>
 Though this may not be categorized specifically as a language, HTML is heavily used in creating web pages. Python or other languages used for websites will ultimately communicate with a browser by sending HTML with the web page content. CSS provides the formatting and styling for the web page.

<h2>-JavaScript:</h2>
 JavaScript is not connected to Java. As its name implies, it is a scripted language ideally suited for web pages and functionality within an application, such as field content validation. 

<h2>-SQL:</h2> 
SQL (Structured Query Language) is another scripted language that is specifically purposed for working with databases and their content. SQL can be utilized to easily maintain data, insert and modify records or fields, and generate queries based on database contents and multiple selection criteria.
